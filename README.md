# Item Finder
We’ve all been in those annoying situations where we tend to forget a necessary object at the very crucial moment and go haywire locating the same. 
And to save you from losing your time and temper, here's a convenient way to locate the misplaced items.

A voice command is sent from the Android application. 
The message is converted to a text command within the application and thereafter transmitted to the Master Arduino. The Master Arduino will check if the device wanted is in range or not, and an error message will be displayed on the app when the required object is not reachable. We’ve attached NRF sensors to all our Modules. Whenever an object is called, the nRF sensor will generate the signal for transmission in RF frequency range. Eventually the object will be tracked with the buzzer sound
